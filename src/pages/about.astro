            <p>
                I've been tinkering with programming languages since I was a
                teenager. Since then, I've done everything from designing
                websites to building applications for my personal needs.
            </p>

            <p>Some awesome things I've worked on include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    My first Github project <Link><href="https://github.com/Thangta03/GeminiAPI-for-youtube-transcript-summarize">
                    </Link>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I care deeply about open-source software, privacy, beautiful visualization, and great user and
                developer experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, eating noodles,
                and having fun with my guitar.
